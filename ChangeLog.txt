| Version 1.0.1      |
| Date    07/22/2015 |
----------------------
- Initial open-source release.
- Updated IOCs.

----------------------
| Version 1.1.0      |
| Date    07/30/2015 |
----------------------
- Updated/augmented IOC files, the result of completed Hacking Team leaked-project anaylysis.
- Removed quick scan mode. Turns out it's not very comprehensive -- the responsible thing is to remove it, even if the program runs much slower using the other technique.
- Milano now reads directly from IOCs (located under the openioc folder).
- Latest IOCs always available in the milano_iocs.tar.gz archive (in the root of the repo).
- Fixed a bug that was preventing program completion in POSIX operating systems (related to trying to check character and block devices).
- Improved report output (now reports completion time in minutes).
- Users should be able to add their own IOCs under openioc/user-added/openioc_1.0 or openioc/user-added/openioc_1.1 (depending on the IOC file format).
