    LIMITATIONS OF SOFTWARE SERVICES

        This software is provided as-is.

        This software is designed to detect signatures for indicators of
        compromise ("IOCs") specifically to indicate systems compromised by
        Hacking Team exploits. Rook Security's intelligence team conducted
        extensive analysis on the IOCs provided in this release. The Rook team
        conducted both dynamic and static analysis on the files included in
        the 51 Github projects released under the "Hacked Team" moniker.
        During post-analysis, the Rook team compared hashes of the identified
        potentially malicious files against a number of antivirus vendors and
        industry standard whitelists. None of the hashes identified in this
        release were found in the whitelists searched.

        This release is limited to detection within the filesystem only.
        Registry, network, and other indicators will not be evaluated.

        The application is limited to the signatures identified by Rook
        Security at time of this release. The dynamic nature of filesystems
        limits the files that may be scanned. Some malware may attempt
        filesystem modification. Some malware may attempt rootkits that hide
        detection from scanners. This software will not attempt to uncover
        these hidden files.

        This software will not attempt to remediate detected files.
        Compromised systems may contain remnants of the attack, such as
        registry entries. Attacks may use trojans or other methods to
        compromise other components of the system that will not be detected.
